A Verilog HDL project for CPU cores related to the old MOS 6502 CPU.

Have fun. 

The 65Org16-master branch is for a CPU core with:
  - 32-bit address space
    - by using 16-bit bytes
  - with no specific support for 8-bit bytes
  - with BCD mode as unspecified behaviour
  - and otherwise all opcodes and addressing modes like NMOS 6502

Please use other branches and add a suffix to your core name for
CPU cores with other goals.

Please note:

- The core has had next to no testing,

- A very simple assembler will be released shortly.

- There are also verilog and support files here for a small system on
  FPGA, intended for xilinx spartan 3 as found on OHO GOP 24-pin module.
  The system has a uart module for communication to a host computer,
  which is implemented over i2c. The i2c module is not included for
  copyright reasons.  The system is absolutely minimal but is a work
  in progress,

- As a secondary goal it might be possible to configure the HDL as
  a 6502-compatible core with 8-bit bytes.

- LGPL license v2.1 is used for compatibility with opencores.org and to
  encourage redistribution of any source code improvements.

Notes on the cpu core:

- clk is active on the positive edge (is a phi1 clock)
- reset, IRQ and NMI are active high
- WE replaces, and is inverse sense of, read not write.
- databus has separate DI and DO
- RDY is not implemented
- external memory is assumed synchronous, so external pipelining is needed
- `define SIM for extra simulation instrumentation
- memory accesses may diverge from the original
